- Clicking on CEL/Load invokes the windows standard open file dialog. Browsing an
  original AAT CEL file and click open will load the file into CELImage.
  It doesn't yet color fits the loaded CEL.
- MSG_MOUSECOORDS messages are removed. They caused queue overflow because when
  a file dialog was open, but the mouse moved over drawarea, SDL accumulated the
  events and fired all at once when the dialog was closed. Coordinates are read

  to state.bds.
- ColorSelector selects color only by left clicking on it.

- Pressing ESC or ` when in GetCEL or PutCEL cancels curent operation.
- Image position saved into BDP file. (Needed in CEL)
- PutCEL almost works as expected. Only thing is missing putting the CEL onto the image.

  bugged. (Had to move the bit shift operations after adding the color bits.)

2023.02.10

  selected in tool selector and the tools that cannot be selected. (The latter
  are used internally like GETCEL or PUTCEL.)
- Bugfix in BOX tool.

2023.02.02
- Added a small area showing cursor coordinates and color index under cursor.
