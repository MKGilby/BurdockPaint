Todo:
- Plan button layout on Controls. (what is on screen, and what is behind popups)
- Add buttons to Controls.
- Add Tools and Inks from old version.

2023.01.23
- Cursor drawing optimized. (Removed setting color before every draw by
  calling direct SDL2 procedures instead of MK_SDL2 wrapped ones.)
- Added comment in MKMouse2 about ZIndex. (To be sure.)

2023.01.20
- Added ZIndex to TMouseObject.
- Added TMouseObjects.Sort to sort objects by ZIndex. (Could be better if Add
  would insert the object to it's proper place)
- DrawArea added.
- DrawArea is rendered to PrimaryWindow directly.
- Panning with right mouse buttons works.
- Zooming with mouse wheel works.
- Panning with arrow or WSAD keys works.
- Cursor added to DrawArea.


2023.01.19
- Palette and Image class added.
- Saving temporary image at exit.
- Loading temporary image at startup or creating a new empty one if file not found.
- Comments added on TBDImage class definition.

2023.01.17
- Bottom controls panel appears with one clickable button.
- Clicking the button will select or unselect it.

2023.01.13
- Restarted with SDL2.
- Window appears with a static infobar.
