Todo:

- Configurable autosave interval.

2023.02.14
- Small bugfix in writing color index under cursor.

2023.02.13
- Bugfix with clickin anomaly. Click was on mouseup in TMouseObject, but was
  on mousedown in TDrawArea. Changed it in TDrawArea.

2023.02.12
- GETCEL really copies the selected area into CELImage.
  (It saves it to a PNG on exit, to be sure.)
- CEL is saved on exit and reloaded on startup.
- BUG narrowed down: The colored line appears only in PNG file and
  only with odd width. So the bug is in the PNG writer.
- BUG fixed: Writing paletted images with odd with and 4, 2 or 1 bitdepth was
  bugged. (Had to move the bit shift operations after adding the color bits.)

2023.02.10
- Added Pinnable property to tools, to differentiate between tools that can be
  selected in tool selector and the tools that cannot be selected. (The latter
  are used internally like GETCEL or PUTCEL.)
- Bugfix in BOX tool.

2023.02.02
- Added a small area showing cursor coordinates and color index under cursor.
  (Currently it is the part of Controls, but should separate it, to be visible
  even with hidden Controls.)

2023.02.01
- Drawing shapes respects the (F) button.
- Added a nice splash screen. (Turn it off in the .ini [Settings]/ShowSplash=No)

2023.01.31
- Added (F) (K) and (A) toggle buttons. (Fill shapes, clear key color and use alpha respectively)
- Cosmetics: Fix in system font in letter K and L. These were only 4 pixel width.

2023.01.30
- ESC hides controls and activates CEL picker. Right clicking in any phase will
  return controls and activates previous tool.

2023.01.27
- Using TStreamingTexture as DrawArea. It makes the FPS go over 60.
- Added secondary key mapping form zooming.

2023.01.26
- Changed vibrocolors.
- Added CEL picker. Currently you have to click on GETCEL button to activate.
- Added clipping for image drawing methods.
- Optimized render to screen.
- Added FPS counter. It seems that in lower zoom levels the fps count falls drastically.

2023.01.25
- Quit like in the original. Press Q, and click yes or no, or press Y or N.
- Key mapping added, stored and loaded from the settings.
- You can assign keys to Quit, Yes and No.
- Added keymapping to panning keys, centering and zooming.

2023.01.24
- Added tool and ink buttons.
- Clicking them changes the selection.
- Bugfix in TContainer.HandleEvent.
- Bugfix in TMouseObject.HandleEvent.
- Drawing with tools is working now, using the selected ink.

2023.01.23
- Cursor drawing optimized. (Removed setting color before every draw by
  calling direct SDL2 procedures instead of MK_SDL2 wrapped ones.)
- Added comment in MKMouse2 about ZIndex. (To be sure.)
- Added Inks.
- Added Tools.
- Added overlay image (not using it yet).
- Added Vibrocolors array.

2023.01.20
- Added ZIndex to TMouseObject.
- Added TMouseObjects.Sort to sort objects by ZIndex. (Could be better if Add
  would insert the object to it's proper place)
- DrawArea added.
- DrawArea is rendered to PrimaryWindow directly.
- Panning with right mouse buttons works.
- Zooming with mouse wheel works.
- Panning with arrow or WSAD keys works.
