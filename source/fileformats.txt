1. Basics
=========

  In this program the data are stored in blocks containing three parts:

    Start    Size     Description
      0       1       Data ID. Shows the data the blocks contains.
                      Possible IDs:
                        I (0x49) - Image data
                        C (0x43) - Color data
                        R (0x52) - Region data
                        U (0x55) - UndoSystem data
                        O (0x4F) - Undo operation data
      1       4       Size of the block without the Data ID and the size.
      5     [Size]    The data in uncompressed or ZLib compressed format.

  Each file is containing exactly one block, but each block can contain more blocks.
  So referring to a C-block is a block like above with a Data ID 0x43.


2. Detailed block formats
=========================

  Let's see basic blocks first the go to the more complex ones.


2.1. Color data
---------------

  The standalone color data file (usually with .bdc extension) is a C-block.
  The C-block always has ZLib compressed data. The uncompressed data can
  be one of the 3 versions, allowing store color data efficiently.

  Version 1 uncompressed data structure
  -------------------------------------
    Start   Size                Description (content)
    0       1                   Version marker (0x01)
    1       2                   Count of colors
    3       ColorCount*uint32   Color data

    This is the simplest, stores whole color data after each other.

  Version 2 uncompressed data structure
  -------------------------------------
    Start   Size                Description (content)
    0       1                   Version (0x02)
    1       2                   Count of colors
    3       ColorCount*byte     Blue color data
    .       ColorCount*byte     Green color data
    .       ColorCount*byte     Red color data
    .       ColorCount*byte     Alpha color data

    In this version the color channels are separated allowing greater
    compression ratio in some cases.

  Version 3 uncompressed data structure
  -------------------------------------
    Start   Size                Description (content)
    0       1                  Version (0x03)
    1       2                  Count of colors
    3       ColorCount*byte    Blue color data delta encoded
    .       ColorCount*byte    Green color data delta encoded
    .       ColorCount*byte    Red color data delta encoded
    .       ColorCount*byte    Alpha color data delta encoded

    In this version the separated color channels are delta encoded allowing
    even greater compression ratio with color data containing gradients.

  Delta encoding
  --------------
    First byte is the same as original data
    Second and additional bytes are difference from the previous data byte.

    Example:
      Original data:  01 02 04 05 01 02 01 01
      Delta encoded:  01 01 02 01 FC 01 FF 00

      Encoding:       First=01
                      02-01=01
                      04-02=02
                      05-04=01
                      (01-05) and FF=FC
                      02-01=01
                      (01-02) and FF=FF
                      01-01=00

      Decoding:       First=01
                      01+01=02
                      02+02=04
                      04+01=05
                      (05+FC) and FF=01
                      01+01=02
                      (02+FF) and FF=01
                      01+00=01
                      04+01=05


2.2. Region data
----------------

  Region data is the pixel data of a region of the full image. It is not used
  in standalone files. Region data is an R-block, and always has compressed data.
  The uncompressed region data has only one version yet.

  Version 1 uncompressed region data structure
  --------------------------------------------
    Start   Size                Description (content)
    0       1                   Version (0x01)
    1       2                   Left position of the topleft pixel
    3       2                   Top position of the topleft pixel
    5       2                   Width of the region
    7       2                   Height of the region
    9       width*height*2      Color indices line by line


2.3. Image data
---------------

  This is the first complex block. Image data consist of two parts, color
  data and region data containing the full image. It is an I-block containing
  a C-block and an R-block, so itself has uncommpressed data, but the two
  inside block has compressed data as written above. The usual extension is .bdi.

  Image data format
  -----------------
    Start   Size        Description (content)
    5       ???         Color data in a C-block
    .       ???         Region data in an R-block


2.4. Undo operation data
------------------------

  Undo operation data contains information about one undo/redo operation.
  It is an O-block and has uncompressed data with other blocks inside.

  Undo operation data format
  --------------------------
    Start   Size        Description (content)
    5       1           The type of operation
                          0 - image (drawing, etc.)
                          1 - color (editing colors)

  if the type of operation is image:

    6       ???         The affected region before the operation in an R-block
    .       ???         The affected region after the operation in an R-block

  if the type of operation is color:

    6       ???         The affected color data before the operation in a C-block
    .       ???         The affected color data after the operation in a C-block


2.5. UndoSystem data
--------------------

  UndoSystem data contains info about undo/redo operations. It is an U-block
  and has uncompressed data with O-blocks inside.

  UndoSystem data format
  ----------------------
    Start   Size        Description (content)
    5       2           Undo/redo operation count
    7       ???         O-blocks (count times)
