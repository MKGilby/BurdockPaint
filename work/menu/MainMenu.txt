; The menu structure is compiled from this file
;
; The format is (indentation is important!):
; MenuGroup (this appears in the top menu line)
;   MenuItem (this appears in the dropdown menu) (starts with 2 spaces!)
;     MessageName (corresponding message name, process MSG_MessageName in
;                  program when this menuitem is clicked.)
;     Hint (optional) (Hint that appears in the InfoBar when the mouse is hovered over MenuItem)
;     (These lines starts with 4 spaces!)
;
; You can add comment lines and empty lines anywhere.
;
; During compilation two files will be created:
;   menu.bin - This one will be consumed by the TMenu.Create to create menu structure.
;              It will be created in \data folder.
;   MenuMessages.inc - This one is included in BDPSharedUnit.pas and contains MSG_ constants for MenuItems.
;                      It will be created in \source folder.
;
; Compilation:
;   Run MenuCompiler.exe in this folder.
