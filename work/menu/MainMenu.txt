; The menu structure is compiled from this file
;
; The format is (indentation is important!):
; MenuGroup (this appears in the top menu line)
;   MenuItem (this appears in the dropdown menu) (starts with 2 spaces!)
;     MessageName (corresponding message name, process MSG_MessageName in
;                  program when this menuitem is clicked.)
;     Hint (optional) (Hint that appears in the InfoBar when the mouse is hovered over MenuItem)
;     (These lines starts with 4 spaces!)
;
; You can add comment lines and empty lines anywhere.
;
; During compilation one file will be created:
;   menu.inc - It will be created in \source\includes folder, is included in
;              BDPSharedUnit.pas and contains the following things:
;                - MSG_ constants for MenuItems.
;                - Menu structure data for TMenu.Create.
;
; Compilation:
;   Run MenuCompiler.exe in this folder.
